Swift
====================================

Swift is an open source "port" of Ruby on Rails to PHP.
The goal of this project is to help developers build their web applications in a MVC pattern, which lets developers write more readable code.

## Features

- database backend (LDAP, MySQL)
- MVC
- views (haml)
- relationships between models
- tests
- caching (page, fragment, objects in memcache/files/apc)
- validations
- generators
- i18n
- database migrations
- and plenty more

## Documentation

Because documentation is often changed, we currently don't provide it.
If you want to generate it, run:
phpdoc -d lib -t doc/ -ti "Swift Documentation" -q -dn Swift -s

## Notice

This is an alpha ( preview ) release of Swift. It isn't stable for production yet!
