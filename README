PRF ( PHP - Rails framework )
--------------------------------

PRF is an open source "port" of Ruby on Rails to PHP.
The goal of this project is to help developers build their web applications in a MVC pattern, which lets developers write more readable code.


Features
--------------------------------
- database backend ( currently only Mysql, but will feature Postgresql and others in the future )
- MVC
- caching ( caching objects in memcache/files )
- views ( haml )

In near future:
- relationships between models
- tests
- caching ( page, fragment )
- validations
- generators
- i18n
- database migrations

Notice
--------------------------------
This is an alpha ( preview ) release of PRF. It isn't stable for production yet!
