Swift
--------------------------------

Swift is an open source "port" of Ruby on Rails to PHP.
The goal of this project is to help developers build their web applications in a MVC pattern, which lets developers write more readable code.


Features
--------------------------------
- database backend ( currently only Mysql, but will feature Postgresql and others in the future )
- MVC
- caching ( caching objects in memcache/files )
- views ( haml )

In near future:
- relationships between models
- tests
- caching ( page, fragment )
- validations
- generators
- i18n
- database migrations

Documentation
--------------------------------
Because documentation is often changed, we currently don't provide it.
If you want to generate it, run:
phpdoc -d lib -t doc/ -ti "Swift Documentation" -q -dn Swift -s

Notice
--------------------------------
This is an alpha ( preview ) release of Swift. It isn't stable for production yet!
