PRF ( PHP - Rails framework )
--------------------------------

PRF is an open source "port" of Ruby on Rails to PHP.
The goal of this project is to help developers build their web applications in a MVC pattern, which lets developers write less code.


Features
--------------------------------
- Database backend ( currently only Mysql, but will feature Postgresql and others in the future )
- MVC
- Caching ( objects, only in files now )

In near future:
- Relationships between models
- Tests
- Caching ( page, fragment )
- Views / Templates
- Validations
- Generators
- I18n
- Database migrations

Notice
--------------------------------
This is an alpha ( preview ) release of PRF. It isn't stable for production yet!
